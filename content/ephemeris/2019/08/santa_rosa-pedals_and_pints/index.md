# Santa Rosa: Pedals & Pints
"While the kids are away, the grown-ups will play!"

While our kids were busy playing with grandparents, far off into the distant land of North Cackalacky, Dallas and I decided to check out Santa Rosa, about 45 miles North of our humble abode. Located deep within Sonoma County, Santa Rosa is known equally for it's great breweries and scrumptious wineries.

Exploring on two wheels is always more fun, so we signed up for a Pints & Pedals tour, run by Getaway Adventures. Here's roughly how it went:

Overall Time: 5.5 hours
Movin Time: 2.5 hours
Elevation: 300ft

## Third Street Aleworks

After a wrong turn or two and a few bonus miles, We made it to our first stop: Third Street Aleworks in downtown Santa Rosa.  There was a bit of a concern when we parked and ealized that we didn't have locks, but we were able to sneak the bikes into the back patio area.

So, the beer begins to flow with a a 5-beer flight at Third Street Aleworks. The standout beer here was the **Annadel English Pale With Earl Grey**: A casked beer served at room temperature, it's like a light pale ale mixed with black tea. Unique and yummy.

## Russian River Brewhouse

After Third Street,we wandered somewhat chaotically threw Downtown Santa Rosa: sometimes on the road, sometimes on the sidewalk, sometimes in the crosswalk, but always moving toward more tasty beers. As our guide was trying to sort out the bike security, we headed up to the bar, and were talked into an epic flight of 19 different beers.

While we imbued IPA after IPA, the standout beers here were the two easy-going Belgian inspired sours, or "American Wild Ale" as it's labelled here.  In particular, **Intinction** a Pilsner aged in Sauvignon Blanc barrels with Brettanomyces and fresh Sauvignon Blanc grapes. It's light and zesty, and  as close to a hybrid between a white wine and a funky sour beer that you could imagine. 

Second place goes to **Supplication**, another Brett based sour, but based on a brown ale aged in Pinot Noir wine barrels , and sour cherries. It's a bit stronger and funkier, and is not a beer geared toward sweet tooths. It's a beer with a James Brown level of funk to it. Get down!

## Crooked Goat Brewing

Thoroughly buzzed, we hit the Santa Rosa Creek Tcail toward Sebastapol.  I've never been to downtown Sebastappol before, but it was very charming, particularly the vibrant outdoor market district: The Barlow. Mindful of the fact that we've sampled 24 beers before lunch, we were much more selective here: only choosing the 4 most interesting brews. The beer menu here was an embarassment of riches: beers brewed with just about any fruit  you could imagine: blood orange, blueberry, blackberry, strawberry, honey, coffee. If you like your beers a little strange, this is the place to be.

My favorite beer at CGB was *Bramble*, a blackberry ale. Fruity, tart, refreshing, and simple.  Dallas's favorite was the **Nitro Short Stack**: brewed with fresh local blueberries, lactose, vanilla beans, infused with Nitrogen for a thicker bubblier mouth feel. Both, along with the strawberry flavored **Shakedown**,  were delicious and worth the trip. 

## HopMonk Tavern

 28 beers in, HopMonk didn't stand a chance when it came to drinks. I opted for their Kellerbier, which is a German style beer that is taken from the cellar while still hazy. Think something along the lines of a Helles: more body than a Pilsner. Anyways, it was tasty, but not something to go out of your way for.

 The food here however, is worth heading out of the way for. I opted for their tasty take on a Philly Cheese Steak, but served with Naan. It paired perfectly with the Kellerbier.
