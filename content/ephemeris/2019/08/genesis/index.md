I can't recall if it was Rumi, or Confucious, but I recently read a quote that went something like:

`That which you hold close to your heart, dies with you. That which you share with the world, persists.`

Unfortunately, Googling for this quote turns up nothing, so I may as well claim this remixed wisdom for myself. The point remains: How does one's spirit live on in spite of impermanence?

Is there any value in my children reading a daily account of my folly? Likely not, but at least I will give them the choice to do so.
