## Thomas

### :cyclone: Learning via continuous near-failure

Born in Sweden, and based out of San Francisco, Thomas is imposter syndrome personified:

* A software engineer who didn't attend University
* A Swede who barely speaks Swedish
* A cyclist who prefers the slow and scenic

He is a father of two, and a half-baked explorer, muser, and builder of things. He has spent the last 25 years attempting to replace systems administrators with poorly written simulacrums: first in shell, then in Perl, then Ruby, then Python, and finally in Go.

Today, Thomas works on open-source developer tools at [Google](http://google.com/), where he has been for more than a decade.  His greatest joys are his family, friends, photography, literature, and well-formed Go code.
